# 2022 March - Properties listing

Make sure you do 'composer install'

Then 'composer dump-autoload'

Once autoload is set up, create a new MySQL database called property-listings

Then import the .sql file from the root directory.

After this is imported, run importer.php to populate it

Then you will be ready to code!
