# 2022 March - Properties listing

 Penny Lane Properties is a property listing site developed by the Beetles, the March 2022 cohort of Eyup Academy. 

## Description 

This mobile-first property listing site was built over a four day sprint in May 2022. We used PHP and SQL to create a database and app using data from an API. The project used OOP to create a codebase with maintainable architecture and our focus was on writing code that adhered to SOLID principles, and the project has been unit and browser tested.

## Installing 
Clone the repo:
```
git@github.com:iO-Academy/2022-mar-property-listing.git
```
Navigate to the directory:
``` 
cd 2022-mar-property listings 
```
From the project route run the command:
```
composer install
```
Once loaded run:
```
composer dump-autoload
```

Once autoload is set up, create a new MySQL database called `property-listings`

After this is created, run: 
```
php importer.php
``` 
to populate the database.
