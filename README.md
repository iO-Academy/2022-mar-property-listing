# 2022 March - Properties listing

Make sure you do 'composer install'
<br>
Then 'composer dump-autoload'
<br>
Once autoload is set up, create a new MySQL database called property-listings
<br>
Then import the .sql file from the root directory.
<br>
After this is imported, run importer.php to populate it
<br>
Then you will be ready to code!
